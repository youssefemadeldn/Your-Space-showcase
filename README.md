## Screens

> These are captures from the **design prototype** (`Your-Space-Mobile/doc/design/*.dc.html`), not the live running app — see [Known limitations / TODO](#known-limitations--todo) for real-device screenshots. Full set of frames (loading/empty/wizard-step variants included) lives in `Your-Space-Mobile/doc/design/screenshots/`; a `design-conformance-fixes.md` drift log tracks where the code has since diverged from these mocks.

## What this is

Your Space is a private, single-user-scoped CRM for someone's own social circle — not a multi-tenant social network. A logged-in user maintains **Groups** (e.g. "Family", "Coworkers") and **People** assigned to a group, creates **Events**, builds a per-event guest list from those People, tracks each guest through an invitation status lifecycle, and logs **reciprocity history** — whether a contact has invited *them* to something in the past — so social obligations don't get forgotten.

The product is split into two independently governed, independently deployed projects that share this repo:

| Project | What it is | Full documentation |
|---|---|---|
| **Backend** — `Your-Space-Backend/` | ASP.NET Core / .NET 10 REST API, PostgreSQL, JWT auth, EN/AR localization | Your-Space-Backend/README.md |
| **Mobile** — `Your-Space-Mobile/` | Flutter app (Android + iOS), Clean Architecture, Cubit state management | Your-Space-Mobile/README.md |

This root document is the map of the whole product — for exhaustive, per-project detail (every endpoint, every DI scope, every env var, full test taxonomy) follow the links into each project's own README, which is the authority for its folder.

Full dependency lists with every package and version live in each project's own README — Backend tech stack / Mobile tech stack.

## Product features

The full-stack feature set, as actually implemented (backend controllers + mobile screens/cubits — not aspirational):

- **Authentication** — register, login, JWT access + rotating refresh tokens, email confirmation via OTP, forgot/reset password, change password. Mobile handles token refresh transparently (`AuthInterceptor`); backend enforces per-IP rate limiting on all auth endpoints.
- **Onboarding** — first-run onboarding carousel before the app lands on Home.
- **Home dashboard** — at-a-glance stats screen (`HomeStatsCubit`) showing Groups/People/Events counts with an empty state and quick-nav cards into each section.
- **Groups & sub-groups** — CRUD for contact circles, plus nested sub-groups within a group (`groups/{id}/subgroups`), searchable and paginated.
- **People** — CRUD for personal contacts, each assigned to a Group, via a multi-step person wizard (basic identity → classification & location → relationships → notes). Includes server-side person search, inline "+ Add new" creation of a Group/Sub-group/Governorate/City/Neighborhood directly from the wizard's picker steps without leaving the flow, and multiple profile photos per person (`persons/{id}/images`).
- **Person relationships** — link people to one another with a typed relationship (`persons/{id}/relationships`), editable inline in the wizard.
- **Location reference data** — a Governorate → City → Neighborhood hierarchy (`governorates`, `governorates/{id}/cities`, `cities/{id}/neighborhoods`), used to tag a person's location and to slice guest lists by area.
- **Events** — CRUD for occasions being planned, with a live guest-count breakdown (not invited / invited / skipped).
- **Guest-List / Invitation Planner** — bulk-add to an Event by People, Group, Sub-group, Governorate, City, or Neighborhood; per-guest status transitions (invite / skip / revert); and a progress summary per event.
- **Reciprocity** — a per-person log of past occasions where *they* invited the user, plus a "reciprocity suggestions" endpoint/screen surfacing contacts who've invited the user before but haven't been added to the current event yet.
- **User settings & profile** — profile edit (name, avatar), and account deletion, on both sides. The backend also exposes per-user preference flags (e.g. toggling reciprocity suggestions) via `usersettings`, but the mobile Settings screen does not yet surface a toggle for it — that endpoint currently has no mobile UI.
- **Role-based access control** — `User` / `StandardAdmin` / `SuperAdmin` hierarchy on the backend, with a bootstrap SuperAdmin seeder.
- **Bilingual (EN/AR) throughout** — every user-facing entity field and every response/validation message on the backend has an Arabic counterpart resolved server-side; the mobile app mirrors this with `easy_localization` and RTL-aware layout primitives end to end.

See each project's own README for the endpoint-by-endpoint / screen-by-screen breakdown: Backend features / Mobile features.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **.NET SDK 10.0.202+** — backend
- **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** — local instances for backend development
- **Flutter 3.44.8** (via [FVM](https://fvm.app/), pinned in `Your-Space-Mobile/.fvmrc`) — mobile
- Android Studio / Xcode toolchains if building mobile for a device/emulator

### Running the backend

```bash
cd Your-Space-Backend
dotnet user-secrets init --project YourSpace.WebAPI
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:YourSpaceDB" "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=yourspace;Username=postgres;Password=<local-only>" --project YourSpace.WebAPI
dotnet user-secrets set "Jwt:Key" "<dev-only-signing-key>" --project YourSpace.WebAPI
dotnet restore
dotnet run --project YourSpace.WebAPI
```

Full setup, migrations, Docker build, and every environment variable: Your-Space-Backend/README.md.

### Running the mobile app

```bash
cd Your-Space-Mobile
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run
```

Full setup, environment switching (`--dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=prod`), and build commands: Your-Space-Mobile/README.md.

### Running both together

The mobile app's `ApiConstants.baseUrl` (`Your-Space-Mobile/lib/core/constants/api_constants.dart`) must point at a reachable instance of the backend. The switch machinery for this is a compile-time `--dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=dev|prod` flag, but as of this writing `_devBaseUrl` and `_prodBaseUrl` are set to the identical shared dev deployment URL — there is no separate prod endpoint configured yet, so today the flag has no observable effect; update both constants (or point one at a locally-run API) as needed. There is no orchestration tool (Docker Compose, etc.) wiring the two together in this repo — each project is started independently.

## Architecture

Each project owns its own architecture, enforced independently and never blended (per the root `CLAUDE.md`):

- **Backend** — strict layered architecture (`WebAPI → Services → Repository → Data`), physically split into separate class-library projects, with `NetArchTest` assertions enforcing the layer direction and DTO purity in CI-less local test runs. See Backend architecture.
- **Mobile** — Clean Architecture, feature-first (`presentation → domain → data` per feature, `lib/core/` for shared infrastructure), with features never importing from other features. See Mobile architecture.

The two communicate over a single contract: a versioned (`/api/v1/...`) JSON REST API with a uniform `{ success, message, errorCode, data, statusCode, timestamp, errors }` response envelope, produced by the backend's `ServiceResult<T>` and consumed by the mobile app's `unwrapServiceResult`/`ApiManager`.

## API surface

Base path: `/api/v{version}/...` (currently v1), Bearer JWT auth, EN/AR via `Accept-Language`. Endpoint groups: `auth`, `groups` (+ nested `groups/{id}/subgroups`), `persons` (+ nested `persons/{id}/images`, `persons/{id}/relationships`, `persons/{id}/occasion-history`), `events` (+ nested `events/{id}/guests`), `governorates` (+ nested `governorates/{id}/cities` and `cities/{id}/neighborhoods`), `usersettings`. Full endpoint-by-endpoint tables (methods, routes, DTOs): Backend API overview.

## Environment & secrets

Neither project commits real secrets. The backend uses `dotnet user-secrets` locally and environment variables/a secrets manager in deployed environments (`appsettings*.json` holds shape only) — this now also covers the `R2` section (Cloudflare account id, access/secret key, bucket names) used for avatar and person-photo storage, blank by default so the client builds lazily without failing auth when unset. The mobile app has no secrets to configure at build time — it only switches a compile-time `ENVIRONMENT` define between `dev`/`prod` base URLs, and acquires session tokens at runtime via login. Full key-by-key tables: Backend env vars / Mobile env vars.

## Testing

| Project | Framework | What's covered |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | xUnit + `NetArchTest` | Unit tests per service method, `WebApplicationFactory` integration tests per controller, architecture/layering assertions |
| Mobile | `flutter_test` + `mocktail` | 53 test files mirroring `lib/`: router, storage, widgets, and per-feature repository/cubit/screen tests |

Run each project's suite from inside its own folder — `dotnet test` (backend) / `flutter test` (mobile). File counts above are `find … -name` counts as of this writing (97 files under `Your-Space-Backend/YourSpace.WebAPI.Tests/`, 53 `*_test.dart` under `Your-Space-Mobile/test/`) and drift over time — treat them as indicative. Details: Backend testing / Mobile testing.

## CI/CD

> ⚠️ Not detected anywhere in this repo. No `.github/workflows/`, `azure-pipelines.yml`, `codemagic.yaml`, or similar pipeline configuration exists for either project. Builds, tests, and deploys are currently run manually. The backend ships a ready-to-use multi-stage `Dockerfile` for PaaS hosting (Coolify/Render/Railway-style), but nothing triggers it automatically.

## Documentation & handoffs

The repo-root `doc/` folder collects docs that span both projects:

- **`doc/context/`** — two point-in-time, deeply-verified engineering audits (`project-status.md`, `next-feature-status.md`), useful for historical context on *why* things are shaped the way they are, but **dated 2026-07-27/28 and already stale on specific claims** (e.g. they describe the mobile app as having no feature code yet, which is no longer true — `lib/features/` is now fully built out per Mobile features).
- **`doc/handoffs/`** — dated cross-project handoff notes (`001-post-launch-feedback/`, `001-sprint-branches-merge/`), written when a body of work changed hands.
- **`doc/release-notes/`** — one numbered folder per shipped mobile version, `001_v1.0.0+4` through `007_v5.0.1+10`, each holding the Play Store release note (EN + AR) for that version.
- **`doc/reports/`** — one-off audits (currently `account-deletion-audit-2026-09-01.md`).

Each project *also* keeps its own dated handoff notes under `Your-Space-Backend/doc/handoffs/` and `Your-Space-Mobile/doc/handoffs/`, written at the time a feature landed. Treat anything time-sensitive in any `doc/` folder as a historical snapshot, not current state — the two project READMEs and the code itself are the source of truth.

## Contributing

Governed by the root `CLAUDE.md`:

- Each project's own `CLAUDE.md` (plus its `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/templates/`) is the authority for everything inside its folder — never apply the backend's architecture rules/naming/anti-patterns to the mobile app or vice versa, even where a section name matches (e.g. both have a "Testing discipline" section that means something different in each).
- A task that spans both projects (e.g. a new backend endpoint plus the mobile screen that calls it) should keep each half strictly inside its own project's conventions rather than blending them into one style.
- Commit convention observed in history: scoped conventional-commit prefixes — `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:` — optionally suffixed with a project scope (e.g. `fix(backend):`, `feat(backend):`, `test(backend):`); plain imperative messages appear occasionally otherwise.
- Adding a new project (e.g. a web frontend): give it its own top-level folder with its own `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/rules/` + `.claude/templates/`, and add a row to the table in the root `CLAUDE.md`.

## Known limitations / TODO

- No automated CI/CD pipeline for either project.
- No `LICENSE` file anywhere in the repo — see License.
- No orchestration (Docker Compose, etc.) to run backend + database + mobile together with one command — each is started independently today.
- See each project's own README for project-specific gaps (Backend / Mobile).
